# ScanScreen

To install the required modules (cv2, keyboard, numpy) run this command: 
    
    
    
    -> May need to run as root
      -> pip install -r requirements.txt
      
    -> Alternatively if you are using Visual Studio 2019
      -> Open the .py file in VS2019 then in the top center section, next to the python environment version, there is a small icon shaped like a present.
            Click that button. From there a new window should appear and you will be able to search and add the requirements listed in the .txt file manually.
